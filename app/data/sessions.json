    "description": "Every day brings a new story or movie about how the future will be ruled by Artificial Intelligence.  How far are we away from discovering Skynet anyway? This talk will take us on a mini adventure in AI and machine learning with Clojure.  We’ll take a look at something that is pretty easy for humans to do:  telling the difference between a question, statement, or an LOL in some chat text.   What seems deceptively easy, becomes a bit harder when you take away punctuation marks.   We’ll soon find ourselves on the twisty road of natural language processing, machine learning, and Clojure proto chat bots.",

    "title": "How GraphQL makes building web apps better",
    "description": "GraphQL is an open specification created by Facebook for exchanging data between a client and server. It turns REST on its head by letting the client ask for exactly the data it needs rather than the server sending whatever it thinks is best. In this talk, attendees will learn about what GraphQL is and the basic syntax. We’ll see how it works on the client and the server, and how it can be used to solve some of the most frustrating problems in modern web app development. We’ll also see how powerful features like schema introspection allow you to do things in web development we’ve never been able to do before. Expect to come away with a good understanding of where and how to harness GraphQL on your next project.",

    "description": "If you need to build a MVP for an idea or startup, then you need to have tools that work right now and are ultra-productive. Angular 2 provides a great starting point for this, but you still need to handle Authentication, database, back-end servers, and quality UI components.  AngularFire2 makes the Authentication easy. It provides a real-time, managed database. This means no servers to setup!  Angular2-Polymer gives you easy access to the huge library of standards-based Polymer Web Components. This includes Material Design components, Flexbox Layouts, data grids, and Google components like Google Maps.",
