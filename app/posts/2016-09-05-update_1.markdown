**Early bird tickets ending soon!**  

It's hard to believe that Ohio DevFest 2016 will be here in just over two months!  The organizers are busy collecting the final speaker bio's, session briefs, and working through details to ensure the event is a success.

**In less than two weeks on Sept 16th**, both the Professional and Student early bird discount tickets will end.  Don't wait until the last minute to take advantage of this savings!  Get your ticket today!

We have already had an amazing group of companies already provide sponsorship for the event.  **THANK YOU!**  If your company is interested in helping sponsor the event, we are still accepting sponsorships at all levels.

Finally, if you are interested in volunteering to help during the event (ex: manning registration tables, operating cameras, setup, teardown, etc) please send a note to contact@ohiodevfest.com.  Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!

The Ohio DevFest Organizers
